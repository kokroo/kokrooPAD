# kokrooPAD
macOS userspace driver for creating virtual DS4/Xbox 360 controllers.

Etymology:
I wanted to give it a better name like MUDpad, ViGEmac, etc. but I ended up naming it kokrooPAD to avoid any trademark issues like the one faced by ViGEmBus. If anyone can suggest a better trademark-free name, I am all ears.
